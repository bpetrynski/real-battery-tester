# Real Battery Tester

A comprehensive battery testing tool for macOS that helps diagnose battery health and performance. Unlike standard battery indicators that rely on estimations, this tool is designed to realistically simulate real-life scenarios and measure actual battery strength. It allows you to determine precisely how long your computer will operate on battery power until shutdown under various usage conditions.
